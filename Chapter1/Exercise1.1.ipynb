    "0& \\quad \\text{if $n=0$;}\\\\ \n",

    "(b) Pell numbers arise in the rational approximation to $\\sqrt{2}$. If two large integers $x$ and $y$ form a solution to the Pell equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x^2 - 2 y^2 = \\pm 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "then their ratio $x/y$ provides a close approximatio to $\\sqrt{2}$. The sequence of approximations of this form is:$\\frac{1}{1}, \\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{7}{5}, \\frac{17}{12}, \\frac{41}{29}, \\frac{99}{70}, ...$, where the denominator of each fraction is a Pell number, and the numberator is the sum of a Pell number and its predecessor in the sequence. That is, the solutions have the form:\n",

    "$\\frac{P_{n-1} + P_{n}}{P_n}$.\n",

    "(d) Compare the 20th approximation with the value you obtain from Python's ```math.sqrt(2)```, *by calculating the fractional error*. \n",
