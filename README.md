# Computational Physics I - PHYS 3500K (Spring 2025)

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to Computational Physics I (PHYS 3500K) at Kennesaw State University. Here, you will find examples and notes pertaining to the course, as well as additional material. 

Note that the repository is meant to evolve during the semester. Solutions to the homework problems will appear in a separate repository: https://github.com/apapaefs/phys3500k_sp25_solutions

## Getting started with the repository

### Option 1: Use this if your are unfamiliar with UNIX-like operating systems, git, Python environments, etc.: 

You can launch this repository with Binder, where you can execute the code directly. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/apapaefs/phys3500k_sp25/HEAD)

To access the environment necessary to run the course material, you simply need to click the link above. This will generate a docker image with the necessary pre-requisites for the course material. It will also load all the files available in the repository.

*WARNING*: One disadvantage is that any changes will not be saved on the repository! You will need to save them locally! Also, binder is not always available. 

### Option 2 (semi-advanced): Access on KSU's Timur Workstation

You can also get access to KSU's Timur workstation. This will require some knowledge of UNIX/Linux operating systems. The advantage is that this system is fast and should always be available. 

Instructions will be given on how to access this separately.

### Option 3 (advanced): Your own environment
If you are familiar with git and version control, as well as confident that you can maintain your own Python environment and jupyter, you can go ahead and clone the repository locally: 

```git clone https://github.com/apapaefs/phys3500k_sp25```

To update the repository to the latest version at any instant:

```git pull```

within the directory of the repository.
